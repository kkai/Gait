This application only works on the iPhone 5s 
as it utilizies the M7 co-processor for tracking steps.

This is a simple step counter. It displays how many
steps you did during the day, yesterday, this week, last week
and this month.

To update the count please press the update button 
on the left corner.

Tracking your activity/step count can decrease battery life of your device.
